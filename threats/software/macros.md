# Macros

Malicious macros are a type of computer virus that are spread through the use of macro-enabled documents, such as Microsoft Word or Excel files. These macros, which are small programs or scripts, are embedded within the document and are designed to perform specific actions when the document is opened. They can be used to automate tasks, such as formatting text or creating charts, but they can also be used to infect a computer with malware or to steal sensitive information.

### Common Spread

One of the most common ways that malicious macros are spread is through phishing emails. These emails may contain a link to a macro-enabled document, or they may contain an attachment that contains the macro. When the document is opened, the macro is executed, and the malware is installed on the victim's computer.

### Malicious Actions

Once the malware is installed, it can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions, such as:

* Stealing personal information
* Logging keystrokes
* Taking screenshots of the victim's computer

The malware can also be used to download additional malware or to open a backdoor to the victim's computer, allowing the attacker to gain remote access.

### Spread Through Network

Another way that malicious macros can be used is to spread malware to other computers on a network. For example, a macro-enabled document that is opened on one computer can be used to infect other computers on the same network by using shared resources or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the network's security.

### Protection

To protect against malicious macros, it is important to:

* Be cautious when opening email attachments or clicking on links in emails.
* Keep your computer and software up-to-date with the latest security patches
* Use antivirus software that is capable of detecting and removing malicious macros.
* Educate employees on how to identify phishing emails and how to protect themselves and their organizations against cyber threats.

In conclusion, malicious macros are a type of computer virus that can be spread through macro-enabled documents, such as Microsoft Word or Excel files. They can be used to steal personal information, log keystrokes, take screenshots, and open a backdoor to the victim's computer. To protect against malicious macros, it is important to be cautious when opening email attachments or clicking on links in emails, keep your computer and software up-to-date, use antivirus software, and educate employees on how to identify phishing emails and how to protect themselves and their organizations against cyber threats.
