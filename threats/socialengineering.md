# Social Engineering

Social engineering is the use of psychological manipulation to influence individuals or groups to divulge sensitive information or perform actions that may be harmful to themselves or their organization. These techniques are often used by attackers to gain access to sensitive information or systems, and can be used in conjunction with technical attacks such as phishing or malware.

# Types of Social Engineering

There are several types of social engineering that attackers may use, including:

- Phishing: This is a form of social engineering where attackers send emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank or social media site, in an attempt to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link.
- Baiting: This is a form of social engineering where attackers offer something of value, such as access to a desirable service or product, in exchange for sensitive information or access to a system.
- Scareware: This is a form of social engineering where attackers use fear or urgency to convince individuals to perform an action, such as installing malware or providing sensitive information.
- Pretexting: This is a form of social engineering where attackers create a false identity or scenario in order to gain the trust of the individual or organization they are targeting.
- Tailgating: This is a form of social engineering where attackers follow an individual into a secure area, such as a building or computer network, without proper authorization.
