# ðŸ“³ Push Polling

Push polling is a propaganda technique that involves the use of carefully crafted phone calls to influence people's opinions and behavior. It is a type of political campaigning that attempts to manipulate public opinion by spreading misleading or false information. In a push poll, a caller will ask a series of leading questions that are designed to persuade the recipient to adopt a certain point of view, rather than to collect unbiased data.

Unlike traditional polling, where the aim is to gather data about people's attitudes and opinions, push polling is focused on persuading people to believe something specific. For example, a political campaign might use push polling to convince people that a certain candidate is untrustworthy or that their opponent is corrupt. By presenting these negative opinions as facts and implying that others share them, push pollers aim to sway people's views and influence their behavior.

Push polling is often used in the context of political campaigns, but it can also be used to promote products, services, or other ideas. In some cases, it may be disguised as a legitimate survey, making it difficult for people to recognize that they are being manipulated.

One of the dangers of push polling is that it can spread false or misleading information, which can have serious consequences for both individuals and society as a whole. By exploiting people's fears and biases, push pollers can create a climate of mistrust and division, making it harder for people to work together to solve problems and build a better future.

To protect against push polling, it's important to be aware of the techniques that are used and to question the sources of any information that you receive. By staying informed and vigilant, we can help to protect ourselves and our communities from the harmful effects of propaganda and misinformation.
