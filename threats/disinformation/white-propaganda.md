White propaganda is propaganda that does not hide its origin or nature.[\[1\]](broken-reference)[\[2\]](broken-reference) It is the most common type of propaganda and is distinguished from black propaganda which disguises its origin to discredit an opposing cause.

It typically uses standard public relations techniques and one-sided presentation of an argument. In some languages the word "propaganda" does not have a negative connotation. For example, the Russian word, _propaganda_ (пропаганда) has a neutral connotation, similar to the English word "promotion" (of an opinion or argument). Jacques Ellul, in one of the major books on the subject of propaganda, _Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes_, mentions white propaganda as an acknowledgment of the awareness of the public of attempts being made to influence it. In some states there is a Ministry of Propaganda, for instance; in such a case, one admits that propaganda is being made, its source is known, and its aims and intentions are identified.[\[3\]](broken-reference) Throughout the course of a propaganda campaign, however, white propaganda may serve as a cover for black propaganda when the propagandist seeks to mask the latter.\[_citation needed_]
