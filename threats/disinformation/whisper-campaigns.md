# ðŸ”‡ Whisper Campaigns

Whisper campaigns, also known as dark campaigns or backchanneling, are a type of propaganda tactic used to spread rumors or false information about a person or group, often with the intent of damaging their reputation or influencing public opinion. Unlike overt propaganda, which relies on public statements or media campaigns, whisper campaigns operate behind the scenes, spreading rumors or gossip through personal conversations, phone calls, or social media channels.

The goal of a whisper campaign is to create a sense of doubt or suspicion in the minds of the target audience. By spreading negative information about a person or group in a subtle or secretive manner, the propagandist hopes to sway public opinion against the target. Whisper campaigns can be particularly effective in situations where the target is perceived to have something to hide or is vulnerable to attack.

Whisper campaigns can take many forms. They may involve spreading rumors or innuendo about a political candidate or public figure, leaking damaging information to the press, or manipulating social media discussions through the use of bots or fake accounts. In some cases, whisper campaigns may be part of a larger disinformation campaign designed to sow discord or confusion among the public.

One example of a whisper campaign occurred during the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when rumors began to circulate that Senator John McCain had fathered an illegitimate child with a black woman. Although the rumors were baseless, they were spread through anonymous phone calls and flyers in South Carolina, leading some voters to question McCain's character.

Another example of a whisper campaign occurred during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when rumors were spread about Hillary Clinton's health and her involvement in a supposed "PizzaGate" scandal. Although these rumors were also baseless, they were spread through social media channels and other backchannels, leading some voters to question Clinton's fitness for office.

Overall, whisper campaigns are a powerful tool for propagandists seeking to influence public opinion. By spreading rumors or false information in a subtle or secretive manner, propagandists can sow doubt and confusion among the target audience, potentially swaying public opinion in their favor.
