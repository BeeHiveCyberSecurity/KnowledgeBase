Macros are small programs that can be embedded within a spreadsheet, such as those created in Microsoft Excel. These macros can automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry or calculations. However, they can also be used to deliver malware or perform other malicious actions.

When a user opens a spreadsheet that contains a malicious macro, the macro will often run automatically, without the user being aware. The macro can then perform a variety of actions, such as downloading additional malware, accessing sensitive information on the user's computer, or even taking control of the computer.

To protect against malicious macros, users should be careful when opening spreadsheets from untrusted sources. They should also make sure that macro security is set to the highest level in their spreadsheet software, and that any macros are scanned for malware before they are allowed to run.

It's also worth noting that some Office program, like Excel, have an option to disable macro by default and prompt the user to enable it, it's also a good practice to keep your software updated and use anti-virus software to detect any malicious macro.
