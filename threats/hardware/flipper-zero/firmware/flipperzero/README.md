## Development

Flipper Zero Firmware is written in C, with some bits and pieces written in C++ and armv7m assembly languages. An intermediate level of C knowledge is recommended for comfortable programming. C, C++, and armv7m assembly languages are supported for Flipper applications.

### Requirements

Supported development platforms:

* Windows 10+ with PowerShell and Git (x86\_64)
* macOS 12+ with Command Line tools (x86\_64, arm64)
* Ubuntu 20.04+ with build-essential and Git (x86\_64)

Supported in-circuit debuggers (optional but highly recommended):

* [Flipper Zero Wi-Fi Development Board](https://shop.flipperzero.one/products/wifi-devboard)
* ST-Link
* J-Link

Flipper Build System will take care of all the other dependencies.

### Cloning source code

Make sure you have enough space and clone the source code:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git
```

### Building

Build firmware using Flipper Build Tool:
