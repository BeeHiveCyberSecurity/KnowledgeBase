# Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where a malicious actor attempts to trick a victim into providing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial information, or personal information by disguising as a trustworthy source. This is usually done through fake emails, text messages, or websites that are designed to look legitimate.

Here are a few examples of phishing attacks:

* **Email phishing:** An attacker sends an email that appears to be from a legitimate company or organization, such as a bank or a social media platform. The email may ask the recipient to click on a link or provide their login credentials.
* **Spear phishing:** A more targeted form of email phishing, in which the attacker specifically targets a certain individual or organization. The email may contain personal information about the recipient, making it more convincing.
* **Vishing:** A phishing attack that uses phone calls instead of emails or messages. The attacker may call the victim and pretend to be a representative of a company or organization, asking for personal information or login credentials.
* **Smishing:** A phishing attack that uses text messages. The attacker sends a text message to the victim, asking them to click on a link or provide personal information.

To protect yourself from phishing attacks, it is important to be vigilant and skeptical of unsolicited emails or messages. Always verify the authenticity of an email or website before providing any information. It is also important to use strong and unique passwords, and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.
