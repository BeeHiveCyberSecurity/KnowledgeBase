# Typosquatting

Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking or fake URL, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker registers a domain name that is very similar to a legitimate website's domain name with the intent of deceiving users who mistype the legitimate website's URL into their web browser.

For example, an attacker may register a domain name like "gmil.com" instead of "gmail.com" to trick users who accidentally type "gmil.com" into their web browser, redirecting them to a fake website that may look identical to the legitimate one.

The goal of typosquatting is to trick users into entering their sensitive information like usernames, passwords, credit card details, or installing malware on their device by posing as a legitimate website. It can also be used to generate revenue through ad clicks or by selling counterfeit products.

Typosquatting is a common practice among cybercriminals and it's essential for internet users to pay close attention to the website URLs they visit and ensure that they are legitimate before entering any sensitive information.
