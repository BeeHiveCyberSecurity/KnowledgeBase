# üêõ gdb

GDB, or the GNU Project Debugger, is a software tool used for debugging programs written in C, C++, Fortran, and other programming languages. It is an open-source debugger that is included in most Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, and is widely used by developers to find and fix errors in their code.

GDB provides a command-line interface that allows developers to interact with their programs at a low level. It can be used to set breakpoints, examine the state of a program, and step through code line by line. GDB also provides features such as memory and register inspection, which can be invaluable when tracking down memory leaks and other low-level issues.

One of the most powerful features of GDB is its ability to attach to a running process. This allows developers to inspect a program while it is executing, making it possible to find bugs that may not be reproducible in a test environment. GDB can also be used to profile a program's performance, allowing developers to identify bottlenecks and optimize their code.

GDB supports a wide range of debugging features, including conditional breakpoints, watchpoints, and signals. Conditional breakpoints allow developers to stop execution when a particular condition is met, while watchpoints allow them to monitor changes to a specific variable or memory address. Signals can be used to catch and handle exceptions, allowing developers to gracefully handle errors in their code.

In addition to its core features, GDB also has a number of extensions and plugins that can be used to enhance its capabilities. For example, the Python extension allows developers to write scripts that interact with GDB, while the reverse debugging plugin makes it possible to step backwards through a program's execution.

While GDB can be a powerful tool for developers, it can also be somewhat daunting to use, particularly for those who are new to debugging. However, there are many resources available online that can help developers learn how to use GDB effectively, including tutorials, blog posts, and forums where they can ask questions and get advice from more experienced developers.

In summary, GDB is an essential tool for developers who need to debug programs written in C, C++, Fortran, and other programming languages. Its ability to attach to a running process and inspect its state in real-time makes it an invaluable tool for finding and fixing bugs, while its wide range of features and extensions provide developers with the flexibility they need to solve even the most complex problems.

### Packages and Binaries:

#### gdb <a href="#gdb" id="gdb"></a>

GDB is a source-level debugger, capable of breaking programs at any specific line, displaying variable values, and determining where errors occurred. Currently, gdb supports C, C++, D, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, OpenCL C, Pascal, assembly, Modula-2, Go, and Ada. A must-have for any serious programmer.

**gdbserver**

```
:~# gdbserver --help
Usage:	gdbserver [OPTIONS] COMM PROG [ARGS ...]
	gdbserver [OPTIONS] --attach COMM PID
	gdbserver [OPTIONS] --multi COMM

COMM may either be a tty device (for serial debugging),
HOST:PORT to listen for a TCP connection, or '-' or 'stdio' to use 
stdin/stdout of gdbserver.
PROG is the executable program.  ARGS are arguments passed to inferior.
PID is the process ID to attach to, when --attach is specified.

Operating modes:

  --attach              Attach to running process PID.
  --multi               Start server without a specific program, and
                        only quit when explicitly commanded.
  --once                Exit after the first connection has closed.
  --help                Print this message and then exit.
  --version             Display version information and exit.

Other options:

  --wrapper WRAPPER --  Run WRAPPER to start new programs.
  --disable-randomization
                        Run PROG with address space randomization disabled.
  --no-disable-randomization
                        Don't disable address space randomization when
                        starting PROG.
  --startup-with-shell
                        Start PROG using a shell.  I.e., execs a shell that
                        then execs PROG.  (default)
  --no-startup-with-shell
                        Exec PROG directly instead of using a shell.
                        Disables argument globbing and variable substitution
