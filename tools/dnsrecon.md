# dnsrecon

### dnsrecon Usage Example <a href="#dnsrecon-usage-example" id="dnsrecon-usage-example"></a>

Scan a domain (`-d example.com`), use a dictionary to brute force hostnames (`-D /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt)`, do a standard scan (`-t std`), and save the output to a file (`â€“xml dnsrecon.xml`):

```
:~# dnsrecon -d example.com -D /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt -t std --xml dnsrecon.xml
[*] Performing General Enumeration of Domain:example.com
[*] DNSSEC is configured for example.com
[*] DNSKEYs:
```

#### dnsrecon <a href="#dnsrecon" id="dnsrecon"></a>

DNSRecon is a Python script that provides the ability to perform:

* Check all NS Records for Zone Transfers.
* Enumerate General DNS Records for a given Domain (MX, SOA, NS, A, AAAA, SPF and TXT).
* Perform common SRV Record Enumeration.
* Top Level Domain (TLD) Expansion.
* Check for Wildcard Resolution.
* Brute Force subdomain and host A and AAAA records given a domain and a wordlist.
* Perform a PTR Record lookup for a given IP Range or CIDR.
* Check a DNS Server Cached records for A, AAAA and CNAME
* Records provided a list of host records in a text file to check.
* Enumerate Hosts and Subdomains using Google

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                        Target domain.
  -n NS_SERVER, --name_server NS_SERVER
                        Domain server to use. If none is given, the SOA of the target will be used. Multiple servers can be specified using a comma separated list.
  -r RANGE, --range RANGE
                        IP range for reverse lookup brute force in formats   (first-last) or in (range/bitmask).
  -D DICTIONARY, --dictionary DICTIONARY
                        Dictionary file of subdomain and hostnames to use for brute force.
  -f                    Filter out of brute force domain lookup, records that resolve to the wildcard defined IP address when saving records.
  -a                    Perform AXFR with standard enumeration.
  -s                    Perform a reverse lookup of IPv4 ranges in the SPF record with standard enumeration.

  -y                    Perform Yandex enumeration with standard enumeration.
  -k                    Perform crt.sh enumeration with standard enumeration.
  -w                    Perform deep whois record analysis and reverse lookup of IP ranges found through Whois when doing a standard enumeration.
  -z                    Performs a DNSSEC zone walk with standard enumeration.
  --threads THREADS     Number of threads to use in reverse lookups, forward lookups, brute force and SRV record enumeration.
  --lifetime LIFETIME   Time to wait for a server to respond to a query. default is 3.0
  --tcp                 Use TCP protocol to make queries.
  --db DB               SQLite 3 file to save found records.
  -x XML, --xml XML     XML file to save found records.
  -c CSV, --csv CSV     Save output to a comma separated value file.
  -j JSON, --json JSON  save output to a JSON file.
  --iw                  Continue brute forcing a domain even if a wildcard record is discovered.
  --disable_check_recursion
                        Disables check for recursion on name servers
  --disable_check_bindversion
                        Disables check for BIND version on name servers
  -V, --version         Show DNSrecon version
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Type of enumeration to perform.
                        Possible types:
