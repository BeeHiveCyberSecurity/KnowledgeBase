The Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) is on-disk format for storing computer forensic information. Critical features of AFF include:

* AFF allows you to store both computer forensic data and associated metadata in one or more files.
* AFF allows files to be digital signed, to provide for chain-of-custody and long-term file integrity.
* AFF allows for forensic disk images to stored encrypted and decrypted on-the-fly for processing. This allows disk images containing privacy sensitive material to be stored on the Internet.

This package provides the AFF Toolkit, that is a set of programs for working with computer forensic information. Using these tools you can:

* Interconvert disk images between a variety of formats, including:
  * raw or ‚Äúdd‚Äù;
  * splitraw (in which a single image is split between multiple files);
  * AFF format (in which the entire disk image is stored in a single file);
  * AFD format (in which a disk image is stored in multiple AFF files stored in a single directory);
  * AFM format (in which an AFF file is used to annotate a raw file).
* Compare disk images and report the data or metadata that is different.
* Copy disk images from one location to another, with full verification of data, metadata, and the automatic generation of a chain-of-custody segment.
* Find errors in an AFF file and fix them.
* Print information about a file.
* Print detailed statistics about a file
* Generate a XML representation of a disk image‚Äôs metadata (for example, acquisition time or the serial number of the acquisition device).
* Produce a XML ‚Äúdiskprint‚Äù which allows a disk image to be rapidly fingerprinted without having the computer the SHA1 of the entire disk.

The AFF Toolkit provides these executables: affcat, affcompare, affconvert, affcopy, affcrypto, affdiskprint, affinfo, affix, affrecover, affsegment, affsign, affstats, affuse, affverify and affxml.

or     affcompare [options] -s file1 file2...
       Reports if file was successfully copied to Amazon S3
       checking only for existence, not reading back the bytes.
       (Because all writes to S3 are validated by the MD5 of the object
