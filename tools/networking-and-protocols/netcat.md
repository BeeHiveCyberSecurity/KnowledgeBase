# üåê netcat

### Packages and Binaries:

#### netcat-traditional <a href="#netcat-traditional" id="netcat-traditional"></a>

A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable ‚Äúback-end‚Äù tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.

This is the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù netcat, written by _Hobbit_. It lacks many features found in netcat-openbsd.
