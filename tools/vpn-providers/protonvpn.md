# ProtonVPN

ProtonVPN is a virtual private network (VPN) service provider that was launched in 2017 by Proton Technologies AG, a Swiss-based company that also operates the popular ProtonMail encrypted email service. ProtonVPN is designed to provide users with a high level of privacy and security when they are browsing the internet or accessing online services. In this documentation, we will provide an overview of ProtonVPN, its features, and how to use it.

## Features of ProtonVPN:

* Strong Encryption: ProtonVPN uses AES-256 encryption with RSA-4096 for key exchange, which is considered the strongest encryption available today.
* No Logging: ProtonVPN has a strict no-logging policy, which means that it does not record any user data or online activity.
* Secure Core: ProtonVPN's Secure Core feature routes your internet traffic through multiple servers before it leaves the VPN network, which provides an additional layer of security and anonymity.
* P2P Support: ProtonVPN allows peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing on certain servers, which is useful for users who want to download or upload large files.
* Kill Switch: ProtonVPN has a kill switch feature that automatically stops all internet traffic if the VPN connection is lost, which prevents any data leaks.
* DNS Leak Protection: ProtonVPN provides DNS leak protection, which ensures that your DNS requests are not leaked to your internet service provider (ISP) or any other third-party.
* Tor Over VPN: ProtonVPN supports Tor over VPN, which allows users to access the Tor network through the VPN.
* Multi-Platform Support: ProtonVPN is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and routers.
