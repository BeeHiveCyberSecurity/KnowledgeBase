### hydra Usage Example <a href="#hydra-usage-example" id="hydra-usage-example"></a>

Attempt to login as the root user (`-l root`) using a password list (`-P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt`) with 6 threads (`-t 6`) on the given SSH server (`ssh://192.168.1.123`):

```
:~# hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt -t 6 ssh://192.168.1.123

### pw-inspector Usage Example <a href="#pw-inspector-usage-example" id="pw-inspector-usage-example"></a>

Read in a list of passwords (`-i /usr/share/wordlists/nmap.lst`) and save to a file (`-o /root/passes.txt`), selecting passwords of a minimum length of 6 (`-m 6`) and a maximum length of 10 (`-M 10`):

```
:~# pw-inspector -i /usr/share/wordlists/nmap.lst -o /root/passes.txt -m 6 -M 10
:~# wc -l /usr/share/wordlists/nmap.lst

**dpl4hydra**

Generates a (d)efault (p)assword (l)ist as input for THC hydra

```
:~# dpl4hydra -h
dpl4hydra v0.9.9 (c) 2012 by Roland Kessler (@rokessler)

Syntax: dpl4hydra [help] | [refresh] | [BRAND] | [all]

This script depends on a local (d)efault (p)assword (l)ist called
/root/.dpl4hydra/dpl4hydra_full.csv. If it is not available, regenerate it with
'dpl4hydra refresh'. Source of the default password list is
http://open-sez.me

Options:
  help        Help: Show this message
  refresh     Refresh list: Download the full (d)efault (p)assword (l)ist
              and generate a new local /root/.dpl4hydra/dpl4hydra_full.csv file. Takes time!
  BRAND       Generates a (d)efault (p)assword (l)ist from the local file
              /root/.dpl4hydra/dpl4hydra_full.csv, limiting the output to BRAND systems, using
              the format username:password (as required by THC hydra).
              The output file is called dpl4hydra_BRAND.lst.
  all         Dump list of all systems credentials into dpl4hydra_all.lst.

Example:
# dpl4hydra linksys
File dpl4hydra_linksys.lst was created with 20 entries.
# hydra -C ./dpl4hydra_linksys.lst -t 1 192.168.1.1 http-get /index.asp

```
:~# hydra -h
Hydra v9.4 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Syntax: hydra [[[-l LOGIN|-L FILE] [-p PASS|-P FILE]] | [-C FILE]] [-e nsr] [-o FILE] [-t TASKS] [-M FILE [-T TASKS]] [-w TIME] [-W TIME] [-f] [-s PORT] [-x MIN:MAX:CHARSET] [-c TIME] [-ISOuvVd46] [-m MODULE_OPT] [service://server[:PORT][/OPT]]

  -I        ignore an existing restore file (don't wait 10 seconds)
  -S        perform an SSL connect
  -s PORT   if the service is on a different default port, define it here
  -l LOGIN or -L FILE  login with LOGIN name, or load several logins from FILE
  -p PASS  or -P FILE  try password PASS, or load several passwords from FILE
  -x MIN:MAX:CHARSET  password bruteforce generation, type "-x -h" to get help
  -y        disable use of symbols in bruteforce, see above
  -r        use a non-random shuffling method for option -x
  -e nsr    try "n" null password, "s" login as pass and/or "r" reversed login
  -u        loop around users, not passwords (effective! implied with -x)
  -C FILE   colon separated "login:pass" format, instead of -L/-P options
  -M FILE   list of servers to attack, one entry per line, ':' to specify port
  -o FILE   write found login/password pairs to FILE instead of stdout
  -b FORMAT specify the format for the -o FILE: text(default), json, jsonv1

  -t TASKS  run TASKS number of connects in parallel per target (default: 16)
  -T TASKS  run TASKS connects in parallel overall (for -M, default: 64)
  -w / -W TIME  wait time for a response (32) / between connects per thread (0)
  -c TIME   wait time per login attempt over all threads (enforces -t 1)
  -4 / -6   use IPv4 (default) / IPv6 addresses (put always in [] also in -M)
  -v / -V / -d  verbose mode / show login+pass for each attempt / debug mode 
  -O        use old SSL v2 and v3
  -K        do not redo failed attempts (good for -M mass scanning)
  -q        do not print messages about connection errors
  -U        service module usage details
  -m OPT    options specific for a module, see -U output for information
  -h        more command line options (COMPLETE HELP)
  server    the target: DNS, IP or 192.168.0.0/24 (this OR the -M option)
  service   the service to crack (see below for supported protocols)
  OPT       some service modules support additional input (-U for module help)

Supported services: adam6500 asterisk cisco cisco-enable cobaltstrike cvs firebird ftp[s] http[s]-{head|get|post} http[s]-{get|post}-form http-proxy http-proxy-urlenum icq imap[s] irc ldap2[s] ldap3[-{cram|digest}md5][s] memcached mongodb mssql mysql nntp oracle-listener oracle-sid pcanywhere pcnfs pop3[s] postgres radmin2 rdp redis rexec rlogin rpcap rsh rtsp s7-300 sip smb smtp[s] smtp-enum snmp socks5 ssh sshkey svn teamspeak telnet[s] vmauthd vnc xmpp

**pw-inspector**

A tool to reduce the password list

```
:~# pw-inspector -h
PW-Inspector v0.2 (c) 2005 by van Hauser / THC  [https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra]

Syntax: pw-inspector [-i FILE] [-o FILE] [-m MINLEN] [-M MAXLEN] [-c MINSETS] -l -u -n -p -s

Options:
  -i FILE    file to read passwords from (default: stdin)
  -o FILE    file to write valid passwords to (default: stdout)
  -m MINLEN  minimum length of a valid password
  -M MAXLEN  maximum length of a valid password
  -c MINSETS the minimum number of sets required (default: all given)
Sets:
  -l         lowcase characters (a,b,c,d, etc.)
  -u         upcase characters (A,B,C,D, etc.)
  -n         numbers (1,2,3,4, etc.)
  -p         printable characters (which are not -l/-n/-p, e.g. $,!,/,(,*, etc.)
  -s         special characters - all others not within the sets above

PW-Inspector reads passwords in and prints those which meet the requirements.
The return code is the number of valid passwords found, 0 if none was found.
Use for security: check passwords, if 0 is returned, reject password choice.
Use for hacking: trim your dictionary file to the pw requirements of the target.
Usage only allowed for legal purposes.
