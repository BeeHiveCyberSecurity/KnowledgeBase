ClamAV is a free and open-source antivirus software toolkit that provides real-time protection against viruses, Trojans, and other malware. ClamAV is widely used on Unix-based systems such as Linux, and is also available for Windows.

One of the key features of ClamAV is its ability to detect and remove a wide range of malware threats, including viruses, Trojans, spyware, adware, and other forms of malicious software. ClamAV uses a range of detection techniques, including signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and behavior-based detection, to identify and remove malware threats.

ClamAV can be used in a variety of different configurations, depending on the needs of the user. It can be installed as a standalone antivirus solution, or integrated into a larger security solution. ClamAV can also be used as a command-line tool, or integrated into a variety of different applications.

In addition to its malware detection capabilities, ClamAV provides a range of additional features that make it a powerful tool for security professionals. For example, it includes support for email scanning, allowing it to detect and remove malware threats from incoming and outgoing email messages. ClamAV also includes support for the popular Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) Postfix, which allows it to be integrated into email servers for real-time scanning.

ClamAV is also highly configurable, with a range of options for customizing its behavior and performance. It includes support for multiple scan modes, including on-demand scanning, scheduled scanning, and real-time scanning. ClamAV can also be configured to scan specific files or directories, and to ignore certain types of files or extensions.

One of the key benefits of ClamAV is its open-source nature. As an open-source tool, ClamAV is freely available to download and use, and can be customized and modified by users to meet their specific needs. Additionally, the open-source nature of ClamAV means that it is continually being updated and improved by a large community of developers and security professionals.

In summary, ClamAV is a powerful and versatile antivirus tool that provides real-time protection against a wide range of malware threats. Its support for email scanning, Postfix integration, and customizable scan modes make it a valuable tool for security professionals and administrators. As an open-source tool, it is freely available and highly customizable, making it a valuable addition to any security toolkit.

Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based on libclamav, which can be used by other software.

This package contains the command line interface. Features:

* built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar, Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
* built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
* built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor and others;
* built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft Office and Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF.

For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options for getting it:

* clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is recommended with Internet access.
* clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

**Installed size:** `28.32 MB`\
**How to install:** `sudo apt install clamav`
