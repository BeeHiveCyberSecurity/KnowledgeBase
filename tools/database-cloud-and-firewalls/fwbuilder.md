&#x20;In Firewall Builder, firewall policy is a set of rules, each rule consists of abstract objects which represent real network objects and services (hosts, routers, firewalls, networks, protocols). Firewall Builder helps the user maintain a database of objects and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop operations.

**fwb\_compile\_all**

Wrapper script that compiles policies for multiple firewall objects

```
:~# man fwb_compile_all
fwb_compile_all(1)             Firewall Builder             fwb_compile_all(1)

NAME
       fwb_compile_all  -  Wrapper  script that compiles policies for multiple
       firewall objects

SYNOPSIS
       fwb_compile_all -ffile.xml [-dwdir] [-av] [obj[ obj ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       fwb_compile_all is a wrapper script that compiles policies for  several
       firewall objects in one batch job. This script takes a list of firewall
       object names on the command line (or '-a' command line option, see  be-
       low)  and  calls policy compiler for each one. The script correctly de-
       termines which policy compiler is  needed  depending  on  the  firewall
       platform of each object.

OPTIONS
       -a     The  script  processes  all firewall objects in the "/Firewalls"
              subtree.

       -d wdir
              Specify working directory.  Compiler creates file with  iptables
              script  in  this  directory.  If this parameter is missing, then
              iptables script will be placed in the current working directory.

       -f FILE
              Specify the name of the data file to be processed.

       -v     Script passes this option to the compiler, this makes  it  print
              diagnostic messages indicating its progress.

**fwb\_iosacl**

Policy compiler for Cisco IOS ACL

```
:~# man fwb_iosacl
fwb_pix(1)                     Firewall Builder                     fwb_pix(1)

NAME
       fwb_ipt - Policy compiler for Cisco IOS ACL

SYNOPSIS
       fwb_iosacl [-vV] [-d wdir] [-4] [-6] [-i] -f data_file.xml object_name

DESCRIPTION
       fwb_iosacl  is  firewall  policy compiler component of Firewall Builder
       (see fwbuilder(1)). Compiler reads objects definitions and firewall de-
       scription  from  the data file specified with "-f" option and generates
       resultant Cisco IOS ACL configuration file. The configuration is  writ-
       ten  to the file with the name the same as the name of the firewall ob-
       ject, plus extension ".fw". Compiler generates  extended  access  lists
       for  Cisco routers running IOS v12.x using "ip access-list <name>" syn-
       tax. Compiler also generates "ip access-group" commands to  assign  ac-
       cess  lists  to interfaces. Generated ACL configuration can be uploaded
       to the router manually or using built-in installer in the  fwbuilder(1)
       GUI.

       The data file and the name of the firewall objects must be specified on
       the command line. Other command line parameters are optional.

OPTIONS
       -4     Generate iptables script for IPv4 part of  the  policy.  If  any
              rules  of  the  firewall  refer to IPv6 addresses, compiler will
              skip these rules.  Options "-4" and "-6" are exclusive. If  nei-
              ther  option  is  used, compiler tries to generate both parts of
              the script, although generation of the IPv6 part  is  controlled
              by  the  option  "Enable  IPv6 support" in the "IPv6" tab of the
              firewall object advanced settings dialog.  This option is off by
              default.

       -6     Generate  iptables  script  for  IPv6 part of the policy. If any
              rules of the firewall refer to  IPv6  addresses,  compiler  will
              skip these rules.

       -f FILE
              Specify the name of the data file to be processed.

       -d wdir
              Specify  working  directory. Compiler creates file with ACL con-
              figuration in this directory.  If  this  parameter  is  missing,
              then  generated ACL will be placed in the current working direc-
              tory.

       -v     Be verbose: compiler prints diagnostic messages when it works.

       -V     Print version number and quit.

       -i     When this option is present, the last argument  on  the  command
              line is supposed to be firewall object ID rather than its name

**fwbuilder**

Multiplatform firewall configuration tool

```
:~# man fwbuilder
fwbuilder(1)                   Firewall Builder                   fwbuilder(1)

NAME
       fwbuilder - Multiplatform firewall configuration tool

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/fwbuilder [-ffile.fwb] [-d] [-h] [-ofile] [-Pobject_name] [-r]
       [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       fwbuilder is the Graphic User Interface  (GUI)  component  of  Firewall
       Builder.

       Firewall Builder consists of a GUI and set of policy compilers for var-
       ious firewall platforms. It helps users maintain a database of  objects
       and  allows  policy  editing using simple drag-and-drop operations. GUI
       generates firewall description in the form of XML file, which compilers
       then  interpret and generate platform-specific code. Several algorithms
       are provided for automated network objects discovery and bulk import of
       data.  The  GUI  and  policy compilers are completely independent, this
       provides for a consistent abstract model and the same GUI for different
       firewall platforms.

       Firewall  Builder  supports  firewalls  based on iptables (Linux kernel
       2.4.x and 2.6.x, see fwb_ipt(1)), ipfilter (variety  of  platforms  in-
       cluding  *BSD,  Solaris  and  others,  see fwb_ipf(1)), pf (OpenBSD and
       FreeBSD, see fwb_pf(1)), ipfw (FreeBSD and others), Cisco PIX (v6.x and
       7.x) and Cisco IOS extended access lists.

OPTIONS
       -f FILE
              Specify the name of the file to be loaded when program starts.

       -r     When  this  command  line option is given in combination with -f
              file, the program automatically opens RCS head revision  of  the
              file  if file is in RCS. If file is not in RCS, this option does
              nothing and the file is opened as usual.

       -d     Turns on debug mode. Note that in this mode the  program  gener-
              ates  lots  of output on standard error. This is used for debug-
              ging.

       -h     Prints brief help message

       -o file
              Specify the name of the file for the print  output,  see  option
              "-P".

       -P object_name
              Print  rules  and  objects for the firewall object "object_name"
              and immediately exit. The program does not go  into  interactive
              mode.  Print  output  will  be placed in the file specified with
              "-o" option.  If file name is not given with option "-o",  print
              output  is  stored in the file "print.pdf" in the current direc-
              tory.
