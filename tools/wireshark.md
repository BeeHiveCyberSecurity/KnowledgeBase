                           use "-G help" for more help

Dumpcap can benefit from an enabled BPF JIT compiler if available.
You might want to enable it by executing:
 "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable"
Note that this can make your system less secure!

Dumpcap can benefit from an enabled BPF JIT compiler if available.
You might want to enable it by executing:
 "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable"
Note that this can make your system less secure!

Example: dumpcap -i eth0 -a duration:60 -w output.pcapng
"Capture packets from interface eth0 until 60s passed into output.pcapng"

Use Ctrl-C to stop capturing at any time.

**editcap**

Edit and/or translate the format of capture files

```
:~# editcap -h
Editcap (Wireshark) 4.0.3 (Git v4.0.3 packaged as 4.0.3-1)
Edit and/or translate the format of capture files.
See https://www.wireshark.org for more information.

Usage: editcap [options] ... <infile> <outfile> [ <packet#>[-<packet#>] ... ]

<infile> and <outfile> must both be present; use '-' for stdin or stdout.
A single packet or a range of packets can be selected.

Packet selection:
  -r                     keep the selected packets; default is to delete them.
  -A <start time>        only read packets whose timestamp is after (or equal
                         to) the given time.
  -B <stop time>         only read packets whose timestamp is before the
                         given time.
                         Time format for -A/-B options is
                         YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnnnn][Z|+-hh:mm]
                         Unix epoch timestamps are also supported.

Duplicate packet removal:
  --novlan               remove vlan info from packets before checking for duplicates.
  -d                     remove packet if duplicate (window == 5).
  -D <dup window>        remove packet if duplicate; configurable <dup window>.
                         Valid <dup window> values are 0 to 1000000.
                         NOTE: A <dup window> of 0 with -V (verbose option) is
                         useful to print MD5 hashes.
  -w <dup time window>   remove packet if duplicate packet is found EQUAL TO OR
                         LESS THAN <dup time window> prior to current packet.
                         A <dup time window> is specified in relative seconds
                         (e.g. 0.000001).
           NOTE: The use of the 'Duplicate packet removal' options with
           other editcap options except -V may not always work as expected.
           Specifically the -r, -t or -S options will very likely NOT have the
           desired effect if combined with the -d, -D or -w.
  --skip-radiotap-header skip radiotap header when checking for packet duplicates.
                         Useful when processing packets captured by multiple radios
                         on the same channel in the vicinity of each other.

Packet manipulation:
  -s <snaplen>           truncate each packet to max. <snaplen> bytes of data.
  -C [offset:]<choplen>  chop each packet by <choplen> bytes. Positive values
                         chop at the packet beginning, negative values at the
                         packet end. If an optional offset precedes the length,
                         then the bytes chopped will be offset from that value.
                         Positive offsets are from the packet beginning,
                         negative offsets are from the packet end. You can use
                         this option more than once, allowing up to 2 chopping
                         regions within a packet provided that at least 1
                         choplen is positive and at least 1 is negative.
  -L                     adjust the frame (i.e. reported) length when chopping
                         and/or snapping.
  -t <time adjustment>   adjust the timestamp of each packet.
                         <time adjustment> is in relative seconds (e.g. -0.5).
  -S <strict adjustment> adjust timestamp of packets if necessary to ensure
                         strict chronological increasing order. The <strict
                         adjustment> is specified in relative seconds with
                         values of 0 or 0.000001 being the most reasonable.
                         A negative adjustment value will modify timestamps so
                         that each packet's delta time is the absolute value
                         of the adjustment specified. A value of -0 will set
                         all packets to the timestamp of the first packet.
  -E <error probability> set the probability (between 0.0 and 1.0 incl.) that
                         a particular packet byte will be randomly changed.
  -o <change offset>     When used in conjunction with -E, skip some bytes from the
                         beginning of the packet. This allows one to preserve some
                         bytes, in order to have some headers untouched.
  --seed <seed>          When used in conjunction with -E, set the seed to use for
                         the pseudo-random number generator. This allows one to
                         repeat a particular sequence of errors.
  -I <bytes to ignore>   ignore the specified number of bytes at the beginning
                         of the frame during MD5 hash calculation, unless the
                         frame is too short, then the full frame is used.
                         Useful to remove duplicated packets taken on
                         several routers (different mac addresses for
                         example).
                         e.g. -I 26 in case of Ether/IP will ignore
                         ether(14) and IP header(20 - 4(src ip) - 4(dst ip)).
  -a <framenum>:<comment> Add or replace comment for given frame number

Output File(s):
  -c <packets per file>  split the packet output to different files based on
                         uniform packet counts with a maximum of
                         <packets per file> each.
  -i <seconds per file>  split the packet output to different files based on
                         uniform time intervals with a maximum of
                         <seconds per file> each.

                         when writing the output file.  Does not discard
                         secrets added by "--inject-secrets" in the same
                         command line.
  --capture-comment <comment>
                         Add a capture file comment, if supported.
  --discard-capture-comment
                         Discard capture file comments from the input file
                         when writing the output file.  Does not discard
                         comments added by "--capture-comment" in the same
                         command line.

Miscellaneous:
  -h, --help             display this help and exit.
  -V                     verbose output.
                         If -V is used with any of the 'Duplicate Packet
                         Removal' options (-d, -D or -w) then Packet lengths
                         and MD5 hashes are printed to standard-error.
  -v, --version          print version information and exit.

**text2pcap**

Generate a capture file from an ASCII hexdump of packets

```
:~# text2pcap -h
Text2pcap (Wireshark) 4.0.3 (Git v4.0.3 packaged as 4.0.3-1)
Generate a capture file from an ASCII hexdump of packets.
See https://www.wireshark.org for more information.

Usage: text2pcap [options] <infile> <outfile>

where  <infile> specifies input  filename (use - for standard input)
      <outfile> specifies output filename (use - for standard output)

Input:
  -o hex|oct|dec|none    parse offsets as (h)ex, (o)ctal, (d)ecimal, or (n)one;
                         default is hex.
  -t <timefmt>           treat the text before the packet as a date/time code;
                         <timefmt> is a format string supported by strptime,
                         with an optional %f descriptor for fractional seconds.
                         Example: The time "10:15:14.5476" has the format code
                         "%H:%M:%S.%f"
                         The special format string ISO supports ISO-8601 times.
                         NOTE: Date/time fields from the current date/time are
                         used as the default for unspecified fields.
  -D                     the text before the packet starts with an I or an O,
                         indicating that the packet is inbound or outbound.
                         This is used when generating dummy headers if the
                         output format supports it (e.g. pcapng).
  -a                     enable ASCII text dump identification.
                         The start of the ASCII text dump can be identified
                         and excluded from the packet data, even if it looks
                         like a HEX dump.
                         NOTE: Do not enable it if the input file does not
                         contain the ASCII text dump.
  -r <regex>             enable regex mode. Scan the input using <regex>, a Perl
                         compatible regular expression matching a single packet.
                         Named capturing subgroups are used to identify fields:
                         <data> (mand.), and <time>, <dir>, and <seqno> (opt.)
                         The time field format is taken from the -t option
                         Example: -r '^(?<dir>[<>])\s(?<time>\d+:\d\d:\d\d.\d+)\s(?<data>[0-9a-fA-F]+)$'
                         could match a file with lines like
                         > 0:00:00.265620 a130368b000000080060
                         < 0:00:00.295459 a2010800000000000000000800000000
  -b 2|8|16|64           encoding base (radix) of the packet data in regex mode
                         (def: 16: hexadecimal) No effect in hexdump mode.

Output:
  -F <capture type>      set the output file type; default is pcapng.
                         an empty "-F" option will list the file types.
  -E <encap type>        set the output file encapsulation type; default is
                         ether (Ethernet). An empty "-E" option will list
                         the encapsulation types.
  -l <typenum>           set the output file encapsulation type via link-layer
                         type number; default is 1 (Ethernet). See
                         https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html for a list of
                         numbers.
                         Example: -l 7 for ARCNet packets.
  -m <max-packet>        max packet length in output; default is 262144
  -N <intf-name>         assign name to the interface in the pcapng file.

Prepend dummy header:
  -e <l3pid>             prepend dummy Ethernet II header with specified L3PID
                         (in HEX).
                         Example: -e 0x806 to specify an ARP packet.
  -i <proto>             prepend dummy IP header with specified IP protocol
                         (in DECIMAL).
                         Automatically prepends Ethernet header as well if
                         link-layer type is Ethernet.
                         Example: -i 46
  -4 <srcip>,<destip>    prepend dummy IPv4 header with specified
                         dest and source address.
                         Example: -4 10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2
  -6 <srcip>,<destip>    prepend dummy IPv6 header with specified
                         dest and source address.
                         Example: -6 2001:db8::b3ff:fe1e:8329,2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334
  -u <srcp>,<destp>      prepend dummy UDP header with specified
                         source and destination ports (in DECIMAL).
                         Automatically prepends Ethernet & IP headers as well.
                         Example: -u 1000,69 to make the packets look like
                         TFTP/UDP packets.
  -T <srcp>,<destp>      prepend dummy TCP header with specified
                         source and destination ports (in DECIMAL).
                         Automatically prepends Ethernet & IP headers as well.
                         Example: -T 50,60
  -s <srcp>,<dstp>,<tag> prepend dummy SCTP header with specified
                         source/dest ports and verification tag (in DECIMAL).
                         Automatically prepends Ethernet & IP headers as well.
                         Example: -s 30,40,34
  -S <srcp>,<dstp>,<ppi> prepend dummy SCTP header with specified
                         source/dest ports and verification tag 0.
                         Automatically prepends a dummy SCTP DATA
                         chunk header with payload protocol identifier ppi.
                         Example: -S 30,40,34
  -P <dissector>         prepend EXPORTED_PDU header with specified dissector
                         as the payload DISSECTOR_NAME tag.
                         Automatically sets link type to Upper PDU Export.
                         EXPORTED_PDU payload defaults to "data" otherwise.

Diagnostic output:
  --log-level <level>      sets the active log level ("critical", "warning", etc.)
  --log-fatal <level>      sets level to abort the program ("critical" or "warning")
  --log-domains <[!]list>  comma separated list of the active log domains
  --log-debug <[!]list>    comma separated list of domains with "debug" level
  --log-noisy <[!]list>    comma separated list of domains with "noisy" level
  --log-file <path>        file to output messages to (in addition to stderr)
