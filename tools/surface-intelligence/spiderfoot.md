# ðŸ•¸ spiderfoot

Spiderfoot is a powerful open-source security tool that provides users with the ability to conduct reconnaissance and gather intelligence on a wide range of targets. The tool is designed to be highly flexible and customizable, allowing users to tailor their investigations to their specific needs.

At its core, Spiderfoot is a web-based application that enables users to automate the process of gathering information about a target from a variety of sources. The tool has built-in modules that allow it to scrape data from search engines, social media platforms, and other public sources of information. In addition to these built-in modules, Spiderfoot also supports the use of custom modules, which can be created by users to expand the tool's capabilities.

One of the key features of Spiderfoot is its ability to perform passive reconnaissance. This means that the tool can gather information about a target without directly interacting with it. This can be useful for reconnaissance on targets that are sensitive or difficult to access. Passive reconnaissance also makes it more difficult for the target to detect that they are being investigated.

Another important feature of Spiderfoot is its ability to detect vulnerabilities and potential security risks. The tool can scan a target's web infrastructure and identify weaknesses in its security posture. This can include outdated software, misconfigured servers, and other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

Spiderfoot also provides users with the ability to analyze and visualize the data that it gathers. The tool can generate reports that summarize the information collected during an investigation, making it easier for users to identify patterns and trends. The tool also includes a range of visualization options, such as graphs and charts, which can help users to better understand the data that they have collected.

Overall, Spiderfoot is a highly useful tool for conducting reconnaissance and gathering intelligence on a wide range of targets. Its flexibility and customization options make it suitable for a variety of use cases, including vulnerability assessments, threat intelligence gathering, and social engineering research. While the tool does require some technical expertise to use effectively, its user-friendly interface and extensive documentation make it accessible to users of all skill levels.

### Packages and Binaries:

#### spiderfoot <a href="#spiderfoot" id="spiderfoot"></a>

This package contains an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. Its goal is to automate the process of gathering intelligence about a given target, which may be an IP address, domain name, hostname, network subnet, ASN, e-mail address or personâ€™s name.

SpiderFoot can be used offensively, i.e. as part of a black-box penetration test to gather information about the target, or defensively to identify what information you or your organisation are freely providing for attackers to use against you.

SpiderFoot 4.0.0: Open Source Intelligence Automation.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Enable debug output.
  -l IP:port            IP and port to listen on.
  -m mod1,mod2,...      Modules to enable.
  -M, --modules         List available modules.
  -C scanID, --correlate scanID
                        Run correlation rules against a scan ID.
  -s TARGET             Target for the scan.
  -t type1,type2,...    Event types to collect (modules selected
                        automatically).
  -u {all,footprint,investigate,passive}
                        Select modules automatically by use case
  -T, --types           List available event types.
  -o {tab,csv,json}     Output format. Tab is default.
  -H                    Don't print field headers, just data.
  -n                    Strip newlines from data.
  -r                    Include the source data field in tab/csv output.
  -S LENGTH             Maximum data length to display. By default, all data
                        is shown.
  -D DELIMITER          Delimiter to use for CSV output. Default is ,.
  -f                    Filter out other event types that weren't requested
                        with -t.
