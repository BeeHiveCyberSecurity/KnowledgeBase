# Applications

Ubuntu comes with many pre-installed applications, but if you require more, the Ubuntu Software Center provides an excellent way to browse the additional applications which are available in the software repositories.

You can read more about managing applications in the [Official Ubuntu Documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/) (see the section on _Adding and Removing Software_) and the SoftwareManagement page.

### Software repositories <a href="#software_repositories" id="software_repositories"></a>

**To search for applications in the software repositories**, either use

* Ubuntu Software Centre (or another package manager of your choice)
* the online package search at [packages.ubuntu.com](http://packages.ubuntu.com/), or
* the Ubuntu Apps Directory at [apps.ubuntu.com](http://apps.ubuntu.com/).

**To read more about repositories**, what they are and what the different repositories in Ubuntu are used for, see the Repositories page.

### Software Equivalents <a href="#software_equivalents" id="software_equivalents"></a>

Looking for a free software equivalent for Windows or Mac software? Look at the SoftwareEquivalents page.

If you are migrating from Mac OSX, also see the Switching from MacOSX page.

If you can't find a suitable free software equivalent, you can try running software from other Operating Systems **inside** of Ubuntu. This includes most Windows applications (and even the entire Windows OS itself).
