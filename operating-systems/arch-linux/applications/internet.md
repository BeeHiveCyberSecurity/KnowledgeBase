**Pastebin services**

See also [Wikipedia:Pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin).

Pastebin services are often used to quote text or images while collaborating and troubleshooting. Pastebin clients provide a convenient way to post from the command line.

**Note:** An acceptable pastebin service does not require enabling JavaScript for viewing, does not display adverts, manipulate the pasted content or require a login. [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/) is blocked for some people because of malware found on the site and has a history of annoying issues (requires JavaScript, displays adverts, inserts CRLF line-endings and displaying CAPTCHAs at random). Do not use it.

**Without a dedicated client**

Some services can be used with more general command line tool, such as CURL. For extensions, such as line numbers, one can use more command line tools. Such as `cat -n`.

* [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) is a file hosting and URL shortening service. Usage examples are:

```
command | curl -F 'file=@-' 0x0.st 
```

or upload a file:

```
curl -F 'file=@-' 0x0.st < file
```

* [ix.io](http://ix.io/) Usage examples are:

```
command | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io 
```

or upload a file:

```
curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io < file
```

* [termbin.com](https://termbin.com/) works with nc.
