# Observation

You’re using your computer and all of a sudden you notice something wrong. Something doesn’t seem to work correctly… it doesn’t do what you expect it to.

Is there something wrong with the hardware or with the software? Is there something wrong in your configuration or the way you’re using the computer? Are you expecting the wrong thing to happen?

You don’t know yet, but one thing is sure: What you saw didn’t match what you expected.

At this stage, this is an **observation**. Something looks wrong, so you start to troubleshoot.

Note

Here’s an example of an observation:“While walking, I felt a pain in my right foot”.

Important

Do not report observations as bugs. Observations are not bugs, they’re observations. If you think your observation might lead to finding a bug, troubleshoot to make sure.
