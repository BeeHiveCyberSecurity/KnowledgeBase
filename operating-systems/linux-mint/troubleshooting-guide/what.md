It’s hard to generalize and there will always be special cases.

Ideally **what** you should report are actual bugs, i.e. issues which are deterministic, understood, analyzed and thus fixable.

Note

Do not report observations, they are rarely useful to developers, and when they are they usually require a large amount of time and efforts to be turned into improvements.
