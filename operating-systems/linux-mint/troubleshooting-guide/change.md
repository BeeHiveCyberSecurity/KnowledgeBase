# Change

When something worked **before** and no longer works **anymore**, an important aspect to troubleshoot is **change**.

What changed recently? Did you install something new? Did you apply updates? Did you change some settings? Are you connecting from a different place?

Reviewing the differences in context between when things worked and when things no longer work is key and can help you identify **responsibility** (i.e. the component responsible for the issue) very rapidly.

Note

Here’s an example of an issue where change is key:“My Nike shoes hurt my right foot. They were fine until I put them in the washing machine.”
