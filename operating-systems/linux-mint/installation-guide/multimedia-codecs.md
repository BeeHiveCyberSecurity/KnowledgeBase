Some multimedia content requires additional codecs to be installed.

Note

If you were online when installing Linux Mint and you ticked the option to install these codecs, they are already installed.

1. Launch Menu ‣ Sound & Video ‣ Install Multimedia Codecs.
2. Click Install.
3. Enter your password and wait for the codecs to be installed on your computer.
