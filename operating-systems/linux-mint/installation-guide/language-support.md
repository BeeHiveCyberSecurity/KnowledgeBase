Language support includes translations but also packages related to spell-checking, synonyms, hyphenation and dictionaries which enhance your experience in software applications such as LibreOffice.

1. Launch Menu ‣ Preferences ‣ Languages.



2. Click Install / Remove Language.



3. If beside your locale, you see a label saying `Some language packs are missing`, select your locale and click Install language packs.
