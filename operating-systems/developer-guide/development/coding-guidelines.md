# Coding Guidelines

### Coding Style

#### Simplicity

Prefer simple instructions over complicated ones, even if that means using more lines or duplicating code.

Avoid one-liners, complicated conditions, language specificities and abstract/generic patterns.

If your code needs to be explained, comment it.. or even better, rewrite it in a simpler way.

#### Consistency

Adopt the coding style used in the project you’re contributing to.

This guarantees consistency between your new code and the existing code.

#### Indentation

In new projects or new files, do not use tabs. Use 4 space characters instead.

#### Trailing spaces

Do not leave trailing spaces in your code.

Hint

In Sublime, install the `TrailingSpaces` plugin to automatically highlight trailing spaces and give you the option to easily delete them.

#### Maximum Line length

Fit your code within 120 columns.

If a line of code is longer than 120 characters, break it into two or more lines.

Hint

In Sublime, select View ‣ Ruler ‣ 120 to show a ruler.
