# Getting Started

You don’t need much to get started. If you know more than us you’ll teach us, if we know more than you, we’ll teach you :)

That said, there are a few things you’ll require before going further. Let’s go through them.

### Speaking English[¶](broken-reference)

Developers come from all around the World, if you speak English you’ll be able to work with anybody.

You’re probably OK if you’re here reading this guide. You don’t need to be fluent or to have great English, but you need to understand English enough to communicate.

### Knowing how to use Git[¶](broken-reference)

Git is the version control system we’re using to keep track of changes. We’re using it all the time and everywhere.

If you don’t know about Git, stop right there, you need to learn it.

To learn Git, visit [Github.io](https://try.github.io/).

Make sure you’re familiar with the concepts of commits, branches, remotes, reverts and rebases.

Hint

If you’re new to Git, enjoy! It’s both easy and really fun.

If you ask developers around the team, most will tell you Git is by far their favorite toy.

### Knowing how to use Github[¶](broken-reference)

We’re using Github to host our Git repositories and to work together on the code.

You’ll need to have a Github account set up.

To open a Github account, visit [Github.com](https://github.com/).

You’ll also need to know how to use Github to browse code changes, to fork a project, to make pull requests, etc..

To set up your Github account properly and learn how to use Github, visit the [Github Help](https://help.github.com/).

### Running Linux[¶](broken-reference)

For most projects, you’ll need a computer running the latest version of Linux Mint or LMDE.

You can run an earlier version, or a different distribution, but if you run the latest Linux Mint or LMDE release you’re guaranteed everything will work.
