# Kali Tools

Users have a few areas where they can look for information about a tool in Kali.

[Local information](broken-reference)

The first place users should look to is whatever local information is available. Through man pages and help output, many uses of tools will be seen. Remember to just run `man tool-name` or `tool-name --help` when you’re unsure of a certain flag and you should be good. However, what if you don’t know at all what a tool is used for, and you don’t learn much from either resource?

[Online information](broken-reference)

If man pages and help output didn’t answer questions, then perhaps [tools.kali](https://www.kali.org/tools) will be of assistance. With use case examples, the man page/help output, and descriptions for the tool, there is a lot of information to be gained by looking at a tool. Additionally, each tool’s page links to the upstream website which may provide additional information for the tool.
