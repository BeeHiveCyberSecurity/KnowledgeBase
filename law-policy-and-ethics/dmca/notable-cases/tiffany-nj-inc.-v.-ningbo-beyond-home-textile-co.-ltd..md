Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. has a large manufacturing base in China and exports its products to countries around the world.

## The Lawsuit

In 2013, Tiffany & Co. filed a lawsuit against Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged that Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. was manufacturing and selling counterfeit Tiffany & Co. merchandise, including bedding and towels, which infringed on Tiffany & Co.'s trademark rights.

Tiffany & Co. claimed that Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. was using the Tiffany & Co. name and trademark without authorization and was therefore engaging in unfair competition and trademark infringement. Tiffany & Co. sought an injunction to stop Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. from manufacturing and selling counterfeit Tiffany & Co. merchandise, as well as damages for the harm caused by the infringement.

Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. denied the allegations and claimed that it had not intentionally infringed on Tiffany & Co.'s trademark rights. The company argued that it had purchased the fabric used to make the bedding and towels from a supplier in China, who had assured Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. that the fabric was not infringing on any trademarks.

## Outcome

In 2015, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of Tiffany & Co. and awarded the company $2.2 million in damages. The court found that Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. had willfully infringed on Tiffany & Co.'s trademark rights by using the Tiffany & Co. name and trademark without authorization.

The court also found that Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. had failed to take sufficient steps to ensure that the fabric used to make the bedding and towels did not infringe on any trademarks. The court noted that Ningbo Beyond Home Textile Co., Ltd. had failed to conduct any trademark searches or seek legal advice before manufacturing and selling the counterfeit merchandise.

The ruling in favor of Tiffany & Co. was significant because it demonstrated the importance of protecting trademark rights in the luxury goods industry. The ruling also sent a strong message to manufacturers in China and other countries that infringing on the trademarks of well-known brands can result in significant legal and financial consequences.
