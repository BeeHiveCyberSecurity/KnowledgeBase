# Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset

Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset was a landmark legal case in the United States that involved the illegal sharing of copyrighted music. The case, which was filed in 2006, saw the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sue a Minnesota woman named Jammie Thomas-Rasset for illegally sharing music online. The lawsuit was one of the first to deal with the issue of online piracy and copyright infringement in the digital age.

## Background&#x20;

Jammie Thomas-Rasset was accused of illegally sharing 24 songs on the file-sharing platform Kazaa. The RIAA claimed that she had willfully infringed on their copyrights and was seeking damages of up to $150,000 for each of the songs shared. Thomas-Rasset denied the allegations and argued that she was not responsible for any copyright infringement.

## Legal Proceedings&#x20;

The case went to trial three times. The first trial took place in 2007, and Thomas-Rasset was found guilty of infringing on the copyrights of the 24 songs. The jury awarded damages of $222,000, which was later reduced to $54,000. Thomas-Rasset appealed the decision, arguing that the damages were still excessive.

The second trial took place in 2009, and Thomas-Rasset was again found guilty of infringing on the copyrights of the 24 songs. This time, the jury awarded damages of $1.92 million, which was later reduced to $54,000. Thomas-Rasset again appealed the decision.

The third trial took place in 2010, and Thomas-Rasset was once again found guilty of infringing on the copyrights of the 24 songs. The jury awarded damages of $1.5 million, which was later reduced to $54,000. Thomas-Rasset appealed the decision once again.

## Outcome

&#x20;In 2012, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear Thomas-Rasset's final appeal, effectively ending the case. The damages were set at $9,250 per song, for a total of $220,000. The judgment marked the first time that an individual had been held liable for damages in a music piracy case.

## Impact&#x20;

The case had a significant impact on the music industry and online piracy. It sent a clear message to people who were illegally sharing music online that they could face significant legal consequences. The case also highlighted the challenges that the music industry faced in the digital age and the need to find new ways to protect copyright in the online world.

## Conclusion&#x20;

Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset was a groundbreaking legal case that helped to establish the legal framework for dealing with online piracy and copyright infringement. The case underscored the importance of protecting intellectual property in the digital age and the need for individuals and companies to respect copyright laws.
