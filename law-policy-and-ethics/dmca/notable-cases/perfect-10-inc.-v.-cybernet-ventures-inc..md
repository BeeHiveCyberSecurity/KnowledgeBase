# Perfect 10, Inc. v. Cybernet Ventures, Inc.

The lawsuit of Perfect 10, Inc. v. Cybernet Ventures, Inc. was a landmark case in the realm of copyright infringement on the internet. This case involved Perfect 10, a company that owned a series of copyrighted photographs of nude models, and Cybernet Ventures, which owned and operated a website called AdultCheck.com, which required users to pay a fee to access various adult websites.

Perfect 10 claimed that Cybernet Ventures had infringed on their copyright by displaying Perfect 10's copyrighted photographs on their website without permission. Specifically, Perfect 10 alleged that Cybernet Ventures had displayed thumbnail images of Perfect 10's photographs, which could be clicked on to access larger, high-resolution versions of the photographs. Perfect 10 further claimed that Cybernet Ventures was directly responsible for the infringement because it hosted the infringing images on its servers.

In response, Cybernet Ventures argued that it was not responsible for the infringement because it did not create or upload the infringing content. Instead, Cybernet Ventures claimed that it merely provided access to other websites that hosted the infringing images.

The case was initially heard by the United States District Court for the Central District of California, which ruled in favor of Perfect 10. The court held that Cybernet Ventures was liable for direct copyright infringement because it had displayed thumbnail images of Perfect 10's copyrighted photographs without permission. The court also held that Cybernet Ventures was liable for contributory infringement because it had knowingly facilitated access to infringing content.

Cybernet Ventures appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the district court's ruling. The Ninth Circuit held that Cybernet Ventures was liable for direct infringement because it had created thumbnail images of Perfect 10's photographs and displayed them without permission. The court also held that Cybernet Ventures was liable for contributory infringement because it had knowingly facilitated access to infringing content.

This case set an important precedent for the liability of internet service providers (ISPs) and website operators in cases of copyright infringement. The ruling established that website operators could be held liable for both direct and contributory copyright infringement if they knowingly facilitated access to infringing content. The case also clarified the standard for fair use of copyrighted material, as the Ninth Circuit held that the use of thumbnail images was not fair use because it did not transform the copyrighted work in any meaningful way.

Overall, the case of Perfect 10, Inc. v. Cybernet Ventures, Inc. established important legal principles that continue to shape the way that copyright law is applied on the internet today. It highlights the importance of respecting the rights of copyright owners and the responsibility of ISPs and website operators to prevent and mitigate infringement.
