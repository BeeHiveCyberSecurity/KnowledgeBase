# Cartoon Network LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc.

Cartoon Network LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc. was a lawsuit that took place in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case involved a dispute over a new technology called Remote Storage Digital Video Recorder (RS-DVR) that allowed cable subscribers to record and store TV programs on the cable company's servers instead of a physical DVR in their homes.

## Background

CSC Holdings, Inc., doing business as Cablevision Systems Corporation, is a cable television provider that serves customers in the New York metropolitan area. In 2006, Cablevision announced the launch of its RS-DVR service, which allowed customers to record television programs on Cablevision's servers instead of a physical DVR in their homes.

Cartoon Network LP, along with other television networks, filed a lawsuit against Cablevision in 2006, claiming that the RS-DVR service infringed on their copyrights by creating unauthorized copies of their television programs. The television networks argued that Cablevision's service was no different from a traditional DVR and therefore violated their exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their copyrighted works.

## District Court Decision

In 2007, the district court ruled in favor of Cablevision, holding that the RS-DVR service did not infringe on the television networks' copyrights. The court found that the RS-DVR system was analogous to a traditional DVR and that the copies made by the RS-DVR system were created at the direction of the individual subscribers, not Cablevision. The court further held that Cablevision's service did not violate the public performance right because the transmissions of the recorded programs were made only to the individual subscribers who had requested them.

The court's decision was significant because it recognized that a cable provider could offer a remote recording service without infringing on the copyrights of television networks. The decision also suggested that individual subscribers could make copies of copyrighted works for personal use without infringing on the rights of copyright owners.

## Appeals Court Decision

The television networks appealed the district court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In 2008, the appeals court affirmed the district court's decision, holding that the RS-DVR service did not infringe on the television networks' copyrights. The court agreed with the district court that the RS-DVR system was analogous to a traditional DVR and that the copies made by the system were made at the direction of individual subscribers. The court also held that the transmissions of the recorded programs were not public performances because they were made only to the individual subscribers who had requested them.

The appeals court's decision was significant because it confirmed that a cable provider could offer a remote recording service without infringing on the copyrights of television networks. The decision also clarified the legal status of cloud-based storage services, which allow users to store and access digital content on remote servers.

## Conclusion

The Cartoon Network LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc. case was an important legal battle that helped define the legal status of remote recording services and cloud-based storage services. The court's decisions in this case confirmed that cable providers and individual subscribers could use these technologies without infringing on the copyrights of television networks and other content owners. The case also demonstrated the importance of adapting copyright law to technological changes, as new technologies continue to reshape the way we create, distribute, and consume digital content.
