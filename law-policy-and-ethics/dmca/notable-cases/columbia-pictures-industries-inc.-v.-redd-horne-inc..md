# Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc.

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc. was a landmark case that took place in the United States in 1988. This lawsuit centered around the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials in a promotional campaign by Redd Horne, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of popcorn products.

## Background

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. is a renowned American film studio that produces and distributes motion pictures, television programs, and other entertainment content. In 1984, Columbia Pictures released a popular science fiction film titled "Ghostbusters," which went on to become a blockbuster hit. The film's success led to a number of merchandising and licensing agreements, including a licensing agreement with Redd Horne, Inc.

Redd Horne, Inc. was a popcorn manufacturer and distributor that had been in business for over thirty years. In 1985, Redd Horne entered into a licensing agreement with Columbia Pictures that granted Redd Horne the right to use the "Ghostbusters" trademark in its promotional materials. However, the licensing agreement did not give Redd Horne permission to use any copyrighted materials, such as images from the film.

## The Lawsuit

In 1986, Columbia Pictures filed a lawsuit against Redd Horne, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging copyright infringement. Columbia Pictures claimed that Redd Horne had used images from the "Ghostbusters" film in its promotional materials without permission. Specifically, Columbia Pictures alleged that Redd Horne had used a photograph of the "Ghostbusters" characters on the front of its popcorn bags, and that this constituted an unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material.

Redd Horne, Inc. argued that its use of the "Ghostbusters" image was protected under the doctrine of fair use. Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder, such as for the purpose of commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.

The court, however, ruled in favor of Columbia Pictures, finding that Redd Horne's use of the "Ghostbusters" image was not protected under the doctrine of fair use. The court noted that Redd Horne's use of the image was not for the purpose of commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, but rather for commercial purposes. The court found that Redd Horne had used the image to increase sales of its popcorn products, and that this constituted an infringement of Columbia Pictures' copyrights.

## The Outcome

As a result of the lawsuit, Redd Horne, Inc. was ordered to pay Columbia Pictures $250,000 in damages. Additionally, Redd Horne was ordered to cease and desist from using any copyrighted materials belonging to Columbia Pictures or any other copyright holder without permission.

The Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc. case is significant because it established the principle that the doctrine of fair use does not apply to commercial uses of copyrighted materials. This means that companies cannot use copyrighted materials for commercial purposes without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. The case also underscored the importance of protecting intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry, and helped to set a precedent for future copyright cases.
