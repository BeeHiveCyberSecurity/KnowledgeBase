# Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com

Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. was a landmark lawsuit that took place in the United States in the early 2000s. The case centered around allegations of copyright infringement by Amazon.com and several other companies.

## Background

Perfect 10 was a company that specialized in publishing and distributing photographs of nude models. The company held copyrights on many of the photographs in its collection. In 2004, Perfect 10 filed a lawsuit against Google and Amazon.com, alleging that both companies had infringed on its copyrights by displaying its images in search results without permission.

## Allegations

Perfect 10's lawsuit alleged that Google and Amazon.com had violated its copyrights by displaying thumbnail images of its photographs in search results. The company argued that this constituted direct infringement and contributory infringement. Perfect 10 also claimed that Amazon.com had indirectly infringed on its copyrights by providing hosting services to websites that had posted its images without permission.

## Rulings

In the initial stages of the case, Perfect 10 was successful in obtaining preliminary injunctions against Google and Amazon.com. These injunctions required the companies to remove any images that had been identified as infringing from their search results and hosting services.

However, as the case progressed, the court began to issue rulings that favored Google and Amazon.com. In 2007, the court ruled that Google's display of thumbnail images was protected by fair use. The court found that the use of the images was transformative, as they were used for the purpose of indexing and displaying search results, rather than for their original purpose as erotic images. The court also found that Google's use of the images did not harm Perfect 10's market for its photographs.

In 2009, the court issued a similar ruling in favor of Amazon.com. The court found that Amazon.com was not directly liable for copyright infringement because it did not itself display the infringing images. The court also found that Amazon.com was not liable for contributory infringement because it did not have actual knowledge of the infringing activity and did not materially contribute to it.

## Impact

The rulings in Perfect 10 v. Amazon.com, Inc. had a significant impact on the way that search engines and other online platforms operate. The court's decision on fair use and thumbnail images set a precedent that has been used in subsequent cases involving similar issues. The ruling also clarified the responsibilities of online service providers with regards to copyright infringement, making it more difficult for copyright holders to hold these companies liable for the actions of their users.

Overall, Perfect 10 v. Amazon.com, Inc. was an important case that helped to establish the legal framework for online copyright infringement in the United States. While Perfect 10 was ultimately unsuccessful in its lawsuit, the case set important precedents that continue to be relevant in the digital age.
